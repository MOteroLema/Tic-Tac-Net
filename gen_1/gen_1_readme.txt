First generation of neural players, all trained from the same dataset. The dataset was obtained using games where random
moves were played. The differences between the different players are the number of neurons per deep layer and the number
of deep layers. All models are implemented using rectified linear units as activation functions, and mean squared error as a loss
function. The dataset was collected using 10000 games.
